		<h2>Landing in Paris</h2>
		<p>The flight landed uneventfully at 7:30 AM their time, and I made the mistake of going to the bathroom before going through customs, and had to wait in line for 15 minutes or so.  After grabbing my bag, I sat at a spot next to the McDonalds, ­­got on the free airport wifi, and tried to plan out the best way to get to Paris.  I wanted to take the bus, so that I could see what I was driving by, but figuring out the bus seemed to be too much trouble, so I decided to pony up the 10 euro for the train.  On my way to the station, and after figuring out how to buy tickets, I stood in line at one of the kiosks and met this one gentleman who seemed to have been also having frustrations getting a ticket.  He was griping about the incompetence of the man for not being able to figure out how to buy a train ticket very vocally.  Through his griping I learned he was from Delaware, and he commented on the history of St. Louis and something about train travel before the civil war.  When it was finally his turn, he tried about 3 times to get his tickets before yelling and leaving in frustration (one of the helper people came by to help him with his card, but I am not sure if the kiosk knew what to do with a card without one of those smart chips.)  I got my ticket just fine, and found a 2 euro coin in the drop that someone forgot to pick up.

		<h2>Trying to get into the city</h2>
		<p>
		Went to the platform, and the Gare du Nord stop was not listed in the list of places the train went on the screen.  Every other sign said it did though.  Took a leap of faith with a few other people.  Talked with a girl who had worked here before, who brought her family for the first time.  She made a recommendation for me to stop in Milan in Italy.  And Assisi. Got to the stop and all was well.  Parted ways and started walking in the city.  Couldn’t figure out how the streets were labeled, I later learned that they are placed on the side of the buildings instead on a pole.  Although If the building is curved, there is no sign.

		<h2>Arriving at the hostel and lunch</h2>

		<p>I made it to the hostel, but check in wasn’t until 2pm, 3 hours away.  So I sat outside and chatted with people on my phone and did a bit of people watching.  Later, I found out I could put my backpack in a locker and go out while I wait for check in, so I walked around until I found a bakery, and then got a chocolate croissant and a sandwiches.  Both were excellent. Ate the croissant there, and then walked with the sandwich and ate it by the canal where everyone else was eating their lunch.

		<h2> Wandering Paris </h2>
		<p>After lunch, there was a park nearby, so I decided to check it out.  The park had a playground with a bunch of kids (by the way, all of the playgrounds in this city are enviable).  I saw a public bathroom, and realized I had to go.  I saw one of these in Boston, but basically these are individual restrooms that are self cleaning between each person going to the bathroom.  I went in, and there was no light.  The door closed, and still no light, so I thought maybe I could open the door and close it again, and it would turn on.  Once the door closed a second time, I started hearing a whirring noise.  “Oh crap” I thought to myself, it’s going to start washing with me inside.  I pushed at the door to open it, realizing it was locked.  I started to panic.  I searched frantically (remember it was dark) and finally found a tiny white button which released me to my dry freedom.  I breathed a sigh of relief outside of the bathroom as it continued to clean itself.  There was a group of guys nearby eating lunch that had witnessed my shame, and I decided to move to the bathroom I had seen on the other side of the park.  It was different, and luckily had a light.  All was well.  After the bathroom adventure it was time to check into the hostel.

		<h2>Check-in and more wandering</h2>

		<p>After check in I met Jovino and Ellen who were staying in the 10 person room, and we ended up exploring the area near the hostel, and along the canal.  There was this huge, beautiful park, with many playgrounds and a large grassy area.  There were a lot of metal structures.  We found some people handing out free samples of cream cheese, which had salt added, but they still said it was good for cheesecakes.  I had my doubts.  <br>
		There was a museum of science and technology near, or in the park, I couldn’t tell which, but there was this huge metal ball, kind of similar to the large bean in Chicago, but at least four times as big.  It is called la geode, and it turns out it is an omnimax theater, which was super cool.

		<h2> First dinner in Paris</h2>
		<figure>

			<figcaption>Yum, dinner</figcaption>

		<p>We walked around quite a while longer, and I tried to go down a cool slide that looked like an elephant, but it was backed up with little kids and said it was for people under 14 years of age. I didn't need to cause trouble in my first day in Paris.We continued to walk around for a while, uneventfully, and then headed back to the hostel to find where we wanted to do dinner.  We chose this Arabian restaurant “Les 4 Freres” but the entrance we went to was closed.  (I later found out that the entrance was on the street on the other side of the building.  Instead we went to this Mediterranean restaurant and I had Some delicious thin, crispy beef, and what I assume to be a goat leg.  The waiter/ owner didn’t seem to know much English, but was very lively and mustachioed. Dinner ended at about 11:15 and I was beat from all the walking.  I took a shower and just crashed into bed. Fin.
